# dos-attack-unpacker
With the advance of packing techniques, a few generic and
automatic unpackers have been proposed. These unpackers are designed
to automatically unpack packed binaries without speci¡¥c knowledge of
the packing techniques used. In this paper, we present an automatic
packer with which packed malware forges spurious unpacking behaviors
that lead to a denial-of-service attack on host-based generic unpackers.
We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed
packer and malware produced using the proposed packer, and show the
success of denial-of-service attacks on host-based generic unpackers.
